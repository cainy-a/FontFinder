# FontFinder
Find that font!!!

Yes i am aware I left an OAuth2 token in here. It does not grant you access to my account. It's only there to enable site-wide code searching.

Don't try anything, you're wasting your time.

# Usage
- Build the solution, then run the `GhFontFinder.Cli` executable.
- Specify if you want Truetype (`*.ttf`) fonts
- Specify if you want Opentype (`*.otf`) fonts
- Specify if you want Woff2 (`*.woff2`) webfonts
- Enter the font name
- Wait for results!
- Your output will be in the format `Filename: DirectDownloadLink`
